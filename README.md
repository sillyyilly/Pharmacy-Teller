# Telepharmacy Application

## A modern solution to medication prescription

This is a telepharmacy application where users can build a vitamin pack, upload pictures of their prescription, check the prices of their medication, and transfer refills to a different pharmacy. Users will be able to create an account with a name, list of current medications/vitamins, as well as current pharmacy.

Due to the modernization of technology as well as the demands on technology due to COVID, I believe telepharmacy is the next step for medication prescription. There currently exists some examples of telepharmacies, but the market is not yet saturated and has great potential.

This application is useful for:
- People looking for **more convenient** pharmacy options
- People with medication that must be **consistently refilled**
- People who want to **boost their own immunity** with vitamins
